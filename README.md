# Animal_shelter
### The Dataset  
Some R code for a kaggle competiton I entered. The goal was to create a classifier to predict the outcome of a sheltered animal using features provided for us. The training dataset contains 26,729 observations, 9 predictor variables and was given to us by the Austin Animal Shelter. 

###Exploratory Analysis
Before I dive into creating a classifier, I typically performa exploratory analysis moving from observing one univariate statistics to bivariate statistics and finally modelf building. 

However, I broke from my normal process as curiosity got the best of me. I was interested in learning about what the typical outcomes are for sheltered animals (check out the graph below).
