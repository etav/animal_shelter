# Animal_shelter
### The Dataset  
Some R code for a kaggle competition I entered. The goal was to create a classifier to predict the outcome of a sheltered animal using features provided for us. The training dataset contains 26,729 observations, 9 predictor variables and was given to us by the Austin Animal Shelter.

###Exploratory Analysis
Before I dive into creating a classifier, I typically performa exploratory analysis moving from observing one univariate statistics to bivariate statistics and finally model building.

However, I broke from my normal process as curiosity got the best of me. I was interested in learning about what the typical outcomes are for sheltered animals (check out the graph below).

Luckily, as we see above, many animals are either adopted, transferred or in the case of dogs frequently returned to their owners.  

###The Variables

Variable Name | Description
------------ | -------------
ID | The animal's unique ID
Name | The animal's name, if known (many are not).
